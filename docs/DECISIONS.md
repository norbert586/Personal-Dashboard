# Decisions

Append-only log of choices someone could reasonably question. Newest at the bottom.
To reverse a decision, add a new entry that supersedes it; don't rewrite history.
Format: context, decision, consequences. Keep each entry short.

## ADR-001: One lean doc system

**Accepted · 2026-11-07**
Context: multi-file agent setups drift fast. Duplicate specs, persona prompts and stale plans
end up contradicting each other and burn context.
Decision: exactly five docs, one job each: `CLAUDE.md` (how to work here), `docs/SPEC.md`
(what and why), `docs/DESIGN.md` (look and feel), `docs/DECISIONS.md` (this log),
`docs/ROADMAP.md` (what's next). Values stay in code.
Consequences: before adding a doc, ask which of the five it belongs in.

## ADR-002: Astro 7 + TypeScript, server-rendered with the Node adapter

**Accepted · 2026-11-07**
Context: the old placeholder was a client-only React + MUI SPA. The console is
content-shaped, private and data-driven, and mostly needs HTML rendered on the server.
Decision: Astro 7 with `output: 'server'` and `@astrojs/node` (standalone). Data is fetched
server-side, so secrets never reach the browser. Plain `.astro` components; no UI framework
until a module truly needs client state (then React islands, which Astro supports).
Consequences: runs anywhere Node runs (laptop, Pi, VPS, Docker). Moving to Cloudflare later
means swapping the adapter.

## ADR-003: Plain CSS with design tokens, no UI kit

**Accepted · 2026-11-07**
Context: a distinctive look can't come from a component library's defaults.
Decision: CSS custom properties in `src/styles/tokens.css`, `light-dark()` for themes,
cascade layers, scoped component styles. Fonts self-hosted through Astro's Fonts API (npm
provider, so no third-party font CDN), with metric-matched fallbacks to avoid layout shift.
Consequences: we own every pixel. Tailwind could be added later; tokens would map onto it.

## ADR-004: Private by default, with a fail-closed gate

**Accepted · 2026-11-07**
Context: the console will show personal data and hold API tokens.
Decision: `src/middleware.ts` refuses all requests in production unless `ACCESS_MODE` is set.
The only mode so far is `private-network`: allow loopback, LAN, and Tailscale addresses.
Content Security Policy is enabled.
Consequences: a misconfigured deploy shows a 403, not your data. Caveat: a local tunnel or
reverse proxy (Tailscale Funnel, ngrok, cloudflared) makes every visitor look local. Use
`private-network` only behind tunnels that authenticate (Tailscale Serve, Cloudflare Access),
never public ones.

## ADR-005: Hosting and the access gate

**Proposed, needs Norbert's call**
Options:
A. **Raspberry Pi + Tailscale.** The console runs at home next to the devices it reports on.
It's reachable from your phone and laptop over the tailnet, with no login screen and no
cloud bill. Downside: it's down whenever the Pi is.
B. **Cloudflare + Cloudflare Access.** Always up and free at this scale. Access does the
login (email code or GitHub). To reach the Pi it needs a Cloudflare Tunnel, and the app
needs a `cloudflare-access` mode that verifies Access's signed JWT.
C. **Build our own login.** Only worth it once part of the site is public.
Recommendation: **A now, B later if you want access without Tailscale.** The code already
supports A.

## ADR-006: Where tasks live

**Proposed.** Options: GitHub Issues (already where your code lives), a Markdown checklist in a
private repo, Todoist (good apps and API), or SQLite on the Pi. Decide before M2.

## ADR-007: Sources return readings with provenance

**Accepted · 2026-11-07**
Decision: every source returns `Reading<T>` = data + `live | local | sample | offline` +
fetched-at + detail. The UI shows provenance on every module. Sample data ships first so the
design can be judged before integrations exist.
Consequences: a broken integration degrades one module, never the page.

## ADR-008: Testing strategy

**Accepted · 2026-11-07**
Decision: pure logic gets `node:test` unit tests (Node strips TypeScript types natively, so
no test framework is needed). Pages get Playwright e2e tests against the built server, with
axe accessibility scans in both themes and a check that the gate fails closed.
`npm run verify` runs everything.
Consequences: three dev dependencies cover types, unit, e2e and accessibility checks.
